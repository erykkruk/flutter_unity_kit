## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in unity_kit, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, email **eryk@ravenlab.tech** with:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (if any)

You will receive a response within 48 hours. Once the issue is confirmed, a fix will be released as soon as possible and you will be credited in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Scope

This policy covers the `unity_kit` Flutter plugin, including:

- Dart source code (`lib/`)
- Native Android code (`android/`)
- Native iOS code (`ios/`)
- C# Unity scripts (`unity/`)

Third-party dependencies are outside the scope of this policy, but we will work with upstream maintainers if a dependency vulnerability affects unity_kit users.
